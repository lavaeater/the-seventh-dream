# The Seventh Dream

This project was generated using the [Bevy New 2D](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_new_2d) template.

## Jam Theme and Exploration

Let's brainstorm.

I am involved in a game jam for the game engine Bevy. I have about 12-24 hours of effective time to make a game for the jam. I will keep it simple and TIGHT, so I will make the game in 2D, obviously. 

The theme is "Extremely Incohesive Fever Dream" which is a fantastically open theme, which I like.

What could that mean and reveal as possibilities for a jam game?

I think I need to focus on a tight game play mechanic and loop and consider everything else to be frills.

To capture the Fever Dream aspect, I am thinking something that starts as perhaps a simple shooter but becomes more and more frantic the longer you play. To capture the "incohesive" part of it, I looked up the Merriam-Webster definition and it comes out as "lacking integration". 

That could mean any number of things in a simple 2D shooter...

Perhaps it would work best in a top-down horror-shooter, that would lend itself to being incohesive. 

The name of the game will be "The Seventh Dream" because it is the seventh Bevy Jam and, well, Dream is in the theme...
